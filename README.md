# Predict-COPD-Exacerbations
This was the capstone project in 'R' for the course Machine Learning Methods batch # 1909 submitted by Kruti Shah.
The course covered the feature reduction techniques and 40 + Macine learning methods from Regression, classification and clustering. The capstone project was prepared to demonstrate the above learnings. We were expected to use atleast one feature reduction technique and 4-5 machine learning algorithms. PCA is used as the feature reduction technique. The Machine learning methods used are KNN, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, SVM, ANN and Xtreme Gradient Boosting. There are different set of features considered and each algorithm is run against all the different sets of features. Finally the output from all the algorithms are compared for the best results.

Business problem and question
UHG Provider Business received around 36 M calls in 2017.Out of the 36 M calls received, 7.6 M calls were transferred to other departments further. The projected costs of this 7.6 M transfer calls is around $35M +. There are around 6000 + call advocates handling these transferred calls and they use around 100 + Operations.

Question: Can we predict a call from provider analyzing the claims call data?
